# 3rdSem-Mini-Project-Playlist-Sorter
#### Course: COMP 202
#### Course Instructor: Mr. Sagar Acharya
This project is a part of my 3rd semester Data Structures and Algorithms course and it demonstrates efficient use of data structures and alogorithms in making a playlist sorter. Users can add and delete songs along with the mood associated with each song. The users can also add songs to favourites and search it using the search bar. This project was done using C++ and Qt framework.
